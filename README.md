This repository demonstrates a common issue with React Native's FlatList component: the failure to render all items in a large dataset, particularly when the data changes frequently.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using techniques like `keyExtractor` and optimized data management.  This bug is often subtle and can be difficult to track down, so this repository serves as a valuable reference for developers encountering similar issues.
